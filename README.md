In this repository, I will be uploading different notebooks on quantization, which is a deep learning model compression method. There are several types of quantization and I wish to cover all of them here. 

I am using PyTorch for implementing all the types of [Quantization Methods](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/quantization.html) such as Post-Training Quantization, Quantization Aware Training etc. Let's see how it goes!
